# NAFCEmbryoLarvalStudy

Our study evaluated whether exposure to organic compounds extracted from oil sands process affected waters (OSPW) has adverse effects on fish embryos that persist into later life. We exposed fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) embryos to environmentally relevant concentrations of naphthenic acid fraction components (NAFCs; ranging from 2.5 to 54 mg/L) for 7 days, then raised surviving larvae in outdoor mesocosms of clean lake water for 1 month. Embryos exposed to NAFCs were more likely to exhibit malformations (by up to 8-fold) and had slower heart rates (by up to 24%), compared to controls. Fish raised in clean water, who had been previously exposed to NAFCs as embryos, were 2.5-fold less likely to survive during the larval stage than control fish. Furthermore, these fish showed up to a 45% decrease in swim activity and a 36% increase in burst events during behavioural tests relative to controls. We conclude that brief exposure to NAFCs at the embryo stage can have lasting effects on fish that persist at least into the larval stage. To our knowledge, this is the longest longitudinal study to investigate persistent effects of NAFCs on fish following embryonic exposure, and the first to demonstrate that embryonic NAFC exposure influences larval behaviour. These findings are pertinent for decisions regarding management of oil sands tailings.
